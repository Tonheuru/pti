# Interview with Thomas Curran about the Product, Technology and Innovation Conference 2018

**The theme of this year’s Product, Technology and Innovation Conference is “Being agile – increase collaboration, speed up innovation, ship faster”. What does being agile mean?**

Agile methods grew out of frustrating project experiences of software professionals who had faced the limitations of traditional waterfall development. The idea is to make long-term planning more reliable by continuously adjusting the roadmap based on learnings and insights as they occur, as well as on working in small, bite-sized chunks. But being agile also requires a certain mindset laid out in the agile manifesto created in 2001. In being agile, we value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working solutions over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, responding to change over following a plan.

**And what does “being agile” mean to you, Thomas Curran, personally?**

To me being agile means working in a flexible, responsive and fast way so that you can deliver your product or service in the way the customer wants and in the time the customer needs it. It includes empathy, collaboration, short iterations, rapid prototyping and constant feedback.

**Why should Deutsche Börse be agile?**

In my opinion, being agile is very important to be able to keep up with the pace of today’s business environment of constant change and in order to stay competitive. Being agile empowers companies to focus on rapid delivery of new products and product features and to release them as fast as possible in order to gain an advantage on customer sales and market share. In addition by setting smaller and short-term deadlines comapanies are able to reduce the risk that customer or market demands may have shifted. 

Agile companies also connect deeply with their customers and increase overall customer satisfaction. Besides energizing their customers, teams also benefit from an increased satisfaction due to continually releasing new features and working on different projects rather than working on the same project for months.

**Coming back to the conference in March next year. What can we look forward to concerning agility?**

The purpose of the Product, Technology and Innovation Conference (PTI)  is to provide a format for learning, communication, collaboration and networking and to strengthen the interaction and engagement between colleagues from different areas and other top managers. Andreas Preuss will deliver the keynote. Representatives of all significant Deutsche Börse Group technology platforms, including the digital business platform, will be involved. Topics will especially address product development, process automation, digitisation and customer service. Speeches will range from industry or company specific case studies, product “hands on” demonstrations, customer stories, market overviews or visionary ideas. - PTI is a unique opportunity to learn more about what is going on at Deutsche Börse.
