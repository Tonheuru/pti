Dear speaker,

Thank you very much for participating in Deutsche Börse Group’s 2018 Product, Technology & Innovation Conference. Your inspiring talks and discussions as well as educational presentations and workshops made this conference a successful event.

We would like to make your presentations available in the Deutsche Boerse Intranet, and also share them with all external speakers. Therefore please check your presentation in terms of copyrights (pictures, quotes, graphics) and confidential content and change your presentation if necessary or appropriate, confirm that your presentation can be made available in the Intranet, release the presentation to be shared with all speakers and send a pdf-document to me.

In addition, please share your thoughts and ideas concerning the conference with me. I highly appreciate your honest feedback.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards

Thomas
